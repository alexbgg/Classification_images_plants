Actions so far:
1. Creation of an account at kaggle
2. Downloading the first dataset to local disk: https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/v2-plant-seedlings-dataset
3. Unpacking the zip file
4. First explorations:
	- Multiple png files per subfolder, name of subfolder is the name of the plant?
	- Subfolder "nonsegmentedv2" contains a copy of all the files and this data is redundant?
5. Renamed one folder ("Shepherds Purse") to fix issue with corrupted name
6. Creating a python script to read the attributes of all the pictures, to create a dataframe and to draw some first plots.

Questions:
1. What exactly is our task?
2. What is the type of input/format required to train our model(s)?
3. Do the pictures need to be reformatted (e.g. size to be harmonized, background to be removed)?
4. What is required for Colab? - check Tutorials as suggested by Luigi
5. How to split tasks to make good use of our different talents?
6. How to ensure good follow-up to stay in sync for our activities
